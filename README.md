# Project Description 
This project is an application that is going to suggest Wesleyan resources based on a keyword/words a user enters. It'll have a database to store all the available Wesleyan resources, requests from people, and the effectiveness of each resource in solving students' problems. Not only it is used for generating more information on resources, but also to keep track of resources that are highly in demand, resources students are in need of but aren't yet provided by Wesleyan, and even resources that aren't fully serving the purpose they are dedicated to. Additionally, users can also update the database for resources by adding resources themselves.
